							<h1>FC App (In Developemnt)</h1>
							<h3>Why?</h3>
							<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

								The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

							I am currently working on an app that displays live football scores from an api. Users are then able to select 
							a game and comment on the game with other users. For future development I am planning on implementing the 
							watson speech to text api so that users can use the app to commentate on the games or to chat with other users hands free.

							It was one of my first experiences using React and implementing API's and NPM packages to create a web app
							to then eventually deploying it using Heroku.

							I wanted to experience using Wordpress

							I also used a lot of different plugins and learnt a bit about SEO and some of the things that have to be done in order to rank higher on Google.
							I am definitely interested in using Wordpress again and maybe creating some plugins of my own.

							This app was based on the Noughts and Crosses game. 
							It was expanded to include 4x4 grid and a quiz that you have to answer in order to take your go.
							You have the ability to choose a category for the quiz and it is fully randomized so the player cannot get the same question more than once.

							This was the first website that I made coming out of University to show off some of the projects I had completed.

							I learned that Bootstrap can be very useful for creating webstites in a short space of time.

						<p>
							I graduated from the University of South Wales with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems achieving an upper second class honours.<br><br>
							As a child I always enjoyed making things and taking things apart while also gravitating towards technology and computers as I got older. 
							And ever since saving up the money to build my own PC I’ve always wanted to do something with computers. 
							But it wasn’t until taking Computing class at A-Level that I realised what I enjoyed was programming and using code to create things. 
							Since then I have learnt a lot through multiple university projects and investing my spare time into bettering my knowledge of different technologies.<br><br>
							I have included a list some of the languages and technologies that I have gained a really strong understanding of over the last year or two.
